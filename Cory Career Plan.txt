This project has not shifted my ideals about career paths. Being able to plan a video game as a project has only strengthened my desire to break into the game development industry, however, after being able to collaborate with people on such a project I've learnt many more ways to strengthen my skillset to find myself closer to my ideal career.
Using educational sources online from free/paid courses and classes for an entire subject to video tutorials showcasing different concepts and/or specific programming techniques being among them.

I believe using tools like this, along with experimenting with my own or existing code whenever I can, will greatly benefit me both short and long term. Though I know the best way to really prove my skills is to keep a portfolio of my best work along my journey. Not all programmers have a degree but that doesn't mean they're not great at what they do.
