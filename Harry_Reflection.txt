Group 14 had great cohesion together, as we all chose to work together in the goal of a single aspect, Video games, which allowed everyone in the group to get along much better than if they were assigned. However what could
have been improved is a dedicated time and directive for talking about the project directly, as we had more of a centralised working space where large decisions were made inbetween everything else, meaning they may have gotten lost to some people,
which was what happened to me unfortunately, as my work and personal life means that i was not on the group chat at the same times as everyone else, which caused me to get lost and left behind, and greatly increased my stress, but
due to the fact my other group members are incredible people they have picked up any slack i may have dropped from this forthcoming, however i still would have loved to be a greater force in the driving of this project.
The most surprising thing for our group is how well everyone fit into their assigned categories and roles for the completion of a shared goal once assigned, not fighting for places and things to do, but doing what needed to be 
done for the great the goal, which has shown me that if a group works well enough together then they will be able to accomplish any goal they are set.
