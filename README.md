## Articles

I wrote a summary of the event for the projet write-up in assignment 2 but later edited it out to get the word count down. I've added it to the main directory, _The Batavia Mutiny.docx_

For a longer and more in-depth read, take a look at the Wikipedia page:

For anyone who wants to help work on the story with me (working out staging and decision trees), this should be required reading.

For anyone interested who also has a lot of time to kill, there are the two main primary sources in /articles/primary_sources

Pelsaert's journal is the most important source on this whole event, it's the personal log of the main guy who was in charge of the whole expedition.

The other text, _Ongeluckige Voyagie_, was written 18 years after the event so isn't considered as accurate but is still a good source as it's a bit more succinct than Pelsaert's journal.

Another option is this 1897 translation of _Ongeluckige Voyagie_, which was the first account of the mutiny in English:

## Characters

In the resources folder, _Databases of the people aboard the VOC ships Batavia and Zeewijk FINAL_ is some research on the crew of Batavia (and another ship), including all kinds of personal details like occupation, date and location of death and references to that person in Pelsaert's journal. Ignore all the information about Zeewijk, it's unrelated this project.

You'll also find a copy of _Batavia's Graveyard_ by Mike Dash. It goes into a lot of detail on the background of the significant characters and it will be a great reference when planning the story.

## Level design

In the images folder there is a folder of photos taken by some tourist on their visit to the Batavia replica in the Netherlands. There are lots of great photos taken inside and outside the ship. If anyone wants to knock-up a level of the ship, that would be a good place to start.

Here's an interactive guide/game of Beacon Island shortly before the fishing community there were moved away to protect the grave sites. It's a 1:1 scale walking simulator and gives a nice feel of the scale of the island which would be the primary location of Act 2 of the game. It includes the grave sites currently discovered:
